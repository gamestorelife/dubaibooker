     * Get up and running with Mamo's APIs in less than 5 minutes.
     *
     *  In this example, we will use the Business Details endpoint to ensure we have the right
     * permissions to interact with Mamo's APIs.
     *
     *  ## How to Use Mamo's API Docs
     *  ðŸ‘ˆ To the left, you will find all documents, including individual endpoint reference
     * docs. These will include information on various endpoints, their associated methods and
     * the various responses that your code will need to handle.
     *
     *  ðŸ‘‰ To the right, there's the search bar, language, base URL, code generator and a *try
     * it from the browser* section.
     *  - Use the **language** section to select the language that you plan on writing your
     * code in.
     *  - Use the **base URL** to select the environment you would like the docs to target. We
     * would recommend that you would start with the sandbox environment while you build and
     * test your app.  And later on switch to the production URL once your flows are tested and
     * are working as expected. Hint, our sandbox environment currently does not require an API
     * key. This way you can get started immediately.
     *  - The **code generator** will automatically create a working code snippet based on the
     * values that you provide on a given page. Feel free to copy and paste this straight into
     * your code.  You can also test this using the *Try It!* button below each section. Note
     * that for production requests, you will be required to provide a valid API Key.
     *
     * ## Payment Link Generation
     *  To generate payment links, you can follow the guide on [Create Payment
     * Link](https://mamopay.readme.io/reference/post_links).
     *
     *  The simplest way to test your integration, is by creating a vanilla payment link that
     * has no custom settings.
     *
     *  ``curl  --location 'https://sandbox.dev.business.mamopay.com/manage_api/v1/links'
     *  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
     *  --header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-8d88fac2-d3cf-4060-9eaf-ce6b61434c39'
     *  --data '{
     *  "title": "My Business Name",
     *  "return_url": "https://mamopay.com",
     *  "amount": 10
     *  }'``
     *
     *  ## Receive Payments On Your E-Commerce Website
